# Radar-Detector-Arduino
The Arduino Radar Detector uses an Arduino, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor to scan distances and send data to a Processing (Java) app. The app visualizes readings as a sweeping radar with arcs, angles, and object markers, demonstrating hardwareâ€“software integration and real-time visualization.
